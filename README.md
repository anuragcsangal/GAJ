# 2024 BATCH READ CAREFULLY:

This is the batch which is going to go through the most struggle to find a job.

Companies are not coming for placement, mass recruitment doesn’t even seem like an option.

# THE SOLUTION:

I’m creating a group where we students will come together, build projects, share insights and help each other find a Job.

My goal is to help everyone in the group and help myself get a job in the year 2024.

## What we will do in the group:

    - Each week projects will be assigned to group member. Deadline to complete those projects will be the end of the week i.e. Saturday
    - Share resources - tutorials, blogs, job boards, tweets etc. etc.
    - Become each other’s accountability partners - (idea still in progress, will confirm on discussion)
    - Every Sunday there’ll be a debugging session, where projects of the last week will be discussed, issues will be resolved and projects for the next week will be assigned.
    - LET’S GET A FUCKING JOB BY FEBRUARY 2024
